# Email_classification
This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam (1) or not spam (0) by Python and scikit-learn. It involves cleaning and preprocessing text, converting it into numerical features with TF-IDF and training classifiers like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The model is evaluated by accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
